# **Introduction**
I recently became employed, so I created this project to both kill some time before I start next month and learn & refine some skills that'll increase my productivity while working. It can be implemented in social media projects by using it as an alternative to list-style structures for friends lists, search results that appear based on a search query, etc. Nothing wrong with giving users more options to do something :).<br></br>

# **What I Learned**
* Figma is a godsend for me. It helped me play with the grid's layout, import some styles to SCSS/CSS, and ultimately focus more on its functionality than designing it. I'm currently inexperienced with the tool, but I'll definitely use it for future projects.
* Animations are fun but frustrating to work with if you're not at least decent w/CSS.
